## What is CTR?
While the game has been released for quite a while, I wanted to serve the Call of Duty Community with a tracker.

There may be a few issues still but I'll fix those quickly - I wanted to get this out as soon as possible.

## To-do's / Ideas:
- Add global leaderboards window
- Users leadboards tab (in progress)
- Get percentage of users stats using leaderboards
- Nicer header/menu for the top search bar
- Active profile tab titles
- Add filters to leadboards (Time & Gamemode)
- Add previous/next page buttons to leaderboards (done)
- Leadboards row click event should search/display selected username (or not)
- Compare two users profiles window, maybe side-by-side view
- Next prestige calculator (maybe using monthly stats to get average time played)
- Some graphs/charts (time played, kd ratios, etc.)
- Users emblem (if I can scrape their API) 
- Create a proper logo (made a simple one for now)
- Needs lots of improvements throughout code, needs async functions too
- Cleanup/simplify code, resources and dependencies
